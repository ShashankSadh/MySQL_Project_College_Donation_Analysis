Project Title: SQL Final Project â€“ College Donation Analysis
Tool Used: MySQL (SQL)
Dataset: gift and college tables

Summary:
This project focused on analyzing donation data using SQL to derive insights on gift distributions across colleges. The analysis involved joining two relational tables (gift and college) to perform aggregate calculations, filtering, and grouping operations. Key queries addressed:

Total and average gift amounts by city and college

Number of gifts and their sums by allocation subcategory

Year-wise and city-wise donation trends

Allocation-specific summaries like scholarships, endowments, and campus resources

Donations filtered by major, college, and graduation year

Time-based filtering (e.g., donations received in 2010)

This project demonstrates strong command over SQL joins, aggregate functions, conditional filtering, and group-based analysis, enabling data-driven insights into alumni giving patterns.
